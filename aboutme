I am an editor with a love for texts in all forms. I have dedicated my time to understanding and learning about the struggles minorities have in finding representation of themselves within graphic literature. However, I am skilled in editing text-only material as well. My goal is to help produce error-free materials and help authors properly convey their message to readers.

I have experience editing material about topics that I may not be an expert on. With the Journal of Narrative Theory, I've had to research many diverse topics. This gives me the ability to ensure writers have the strongest argument possible. I'm also skilled in creative writing projects. Working with ComicsVerse has given me the chance to work with creative writers and artists who wish to have their work published. 

In my free time, I love to go swimming or kayaking, take my cats on walks through the woods, and read.
